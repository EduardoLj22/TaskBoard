# TaskBoard
Task Board

A simple Kanban board for task management. This project allows you to create, manage, and track tasks through different stages: To Do, In Progress, and Done. Tasks are color-coded based on their deadlines.

## Features

- *Task Creation*: Add new tasks with a title, description, and deadline.
- *Task Management*: Move tasks between To Do, In Progress, and Done columns using drag and drop.
- *Task Deletion*: Remove tasks from the board.
- *Deadline Indicator*: Tasks are color-coded to indicate their status:
  - *Yellow*: Task is nearing the deadline (less than 3 days).
  - *Red*: Task is overdue.
- *Persistent Storage*: Tasks are saved in localStorage to persist across page reloads.
